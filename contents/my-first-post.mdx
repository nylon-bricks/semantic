# Hello, world!

Welcome to my first MDX post on this blog. I'm excited to share with you how I created this site dynamically using **Gatsby**. In this post, I'll walk you through the steps I took to set up the project, configure MDX support, and create dynamic pages.

## Setting Up the Project

First, I initialized a new Gatsby project using the official Gatsby CLI. Once the setup was complete, I installed the necessary dependencies to enable MDX support, including `@gatsbyjs/gatsby-plugin-mdx` and its required peer dependencies.

```bash
gatsby new my-blog
cd my-blog
npm install @gatsbyjs/gatsby-plugin-mdx
```
