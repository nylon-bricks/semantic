To deploy your forked version of `semantic`, you'll need a server — whether that's your local machine, an EC2 instance, or a cloud platform like `Vercel` or `Netlify`.

However, since `semantic` is built entirely with `Static Site Generation (SSG)`, deploying via `GitHub Pages` is not only possible — it's a great fit.

## Overview
The `semantic` project includes a preconfigured GitHub Actions workflow:
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

This workflow is triggered automatically whenever a commit is pushed to the `main` branch. It builds the project and pushes the output (`out` directory) to the `deploy` branch.

This makes `deploy` a dedicated branch for hosting build artifacts — perfect for **GitHub Pages**.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

Now let’s connect the `deploy` branch to GitHub Pages.

1. <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Pages</strong> in your repository.</p>

2. <p>Under Build and deployment:<br/> - <strong>Source</strong>: Select <code>Deploy from a
      branch</code><br/> - <strong>Branch</strong>: Choose the <code>deploy</code> branch</p>

3. <p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

Wait for the GitHub Actions deployment to finish — and your blog will be live!
