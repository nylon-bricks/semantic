import { Note, Tip, Important, Warning, Caution } from '@/components/mdx'

When writing content, it's essential to effectively emphasize important information such as notes and warnings.

This document explains style options, readability improvements, and accessibility considerations for guiding usersâ€™ attention by importing components in MDX.
