We've been using `Gatsby.js` for quite some time, but it feels like active development has mostly stalled. It's been over two years since `Gatsby 5` was released, and there's still no clear sign of a version `6`. On top of that, outdated dependencies have caused frequent build issues for many users trying to run `semantic`.

To address this, we've rebuilt the blog with `Next.js` using its modern `Static Site Generation (SSG)` approach. The result is a faster, cleaner, and more reliable blogging experience â€” both for contributors and readers.
