If you have cloned the `semantic` template, you will find the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. By default, `semantic` uses GitHub Actions to generate build files in the `gh-pages` branch, which are then hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not wish to deploy to GitHub Pages, simply delete the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.


## Generating a GitHub Token

When a commit is pushed to GitHub, GitHub Actions automatically triggers the build process. The built artifacts are then deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, which requires your personal access token.

You can generate this token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `repo` scope permissions. For simplicity and reliability, it is recommended to create a classic token without an expiration date. <ins>**Never share your token publicly.**</ins>


## Adding the Token to Repository Secrets

To use the token, it must be added to the repository's secrets. Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** in your repository. Click **New repository secret** and add the token.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Name the token `SEMANTIC_DEPLOY_TOKEN` when adding it to the repository secrets.


## All Done!
Once you've set up the secret, you're all set! To verify that the deployment works correctly, re-run the GitHub Action workflow.
