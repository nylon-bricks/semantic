Commenting is an essential part of any blog. It's not just a way to interact with readers — it's also a window into how people are engaging with your content.
That’s why `semantic` comes with built-in support for comments.

Enabling comments is simple: Set the `comments` value to `true` in your post’s frontmatter.

However, since we’re using <a href="https://giscus.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giscus</a>, a few extra configuration steps are required. In this post, we’ll walk through the setup process.

## What is `Giscus`?

While a comment section may look simple, there’s a lot going on under the hood — spam filtering, user authentication, post-to-thread mapping, input forms, comment rendering, and more.

`Giscus` simplifies all of this by integrating with **GitHub Discussions**.
Each blog post is linked to a discussion thread, and comments are stored as replies within that thread. It supports multiple themes and can be styled with custom CSS, giving you full control over the appearance.

It’s a great fit for `semantic`.
(Of course, you're free to replace it with another comment system by modifying `/src/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`.)

Next, let’s connect `Giscus` to your GitHub Discussions board.

## Setting Up `Giscus`

### ① Install the `Giscus` App
First, install the <a href="https://github.com/apps/giscus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giscus GitHub App</a> and grant it access to the repository where comment discussions will be stored.

> [!WARNING]
> This repository must be{" "}`public` for comments to be visible.

We recommend using your forked `semantic` repository as the comment store — this keeps your blog and discussion threads in one place, which improves cohesion and maintainability.

### ② Enable GitHub Discussions

By default, GitHub repositories have Discussions disabled.
To use `Giscus`, you’ll need to enable Discussions in your repository settings.

Refer to the official documentation here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enabling or disabling GitHub Discussions for a repository</a>.

### ③ Review Your Setup

Once the setup is complete, you can enter your repository path below to verify:
